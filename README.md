## Algorithms

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. In regression, it predicts the value of a data point by averaging the values of its k-nearest neighbors.

### 2. Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The algorithm splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

### 3. Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes independence between features, making it computationally efficient and effective for large datasets. It's commonly used in text classification and spam filtering.

### 4. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It improves accuracy and controls over-fitting.

### 5. Neural Networks

Neural Networks are a set of algorithms inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input. They are the foundation of deep learning and are used for various complex tasks.
